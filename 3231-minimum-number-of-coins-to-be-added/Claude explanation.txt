Thank you for providing this example. It helps to clarify the problem and the expected output. Let's break down this example and explain how the algorithm works to solve it.

Input: coins = [1,4,10], target = 19

1. Sort the coins: [1,4,10] (already sorted in this case)
2. Initialize variables: ans = 0, num = 0, i = 0

3. Start the main loop (while num < target):
   
   Step 1: num = 0, coin = 1
   - 1 <= num + 1 (1 <= 1), so we add it
   - num becomes 1

   Step 2: num = 1, coin = 4
   - 4 > num + 1 (4 > 2), so we need to add a new coin
   - We add coin value 2 (num + 1)
   - ans becomes 1, num becomes 3

   Step 3: num = 3, coin = 4
   - 4 <= num + 1 (4 <= 4), so we add it
   - num becomes 7

   Step 4: num = 7, coin = 10
   - 10 > num + 1 (10 > 8), so we need to add a new coin
   - We add coin value 8 (num + 1)
   - ans becomes 2, num becomes 15

   Step 5: num = 15, coin = 10
   - 10 <= num + 1 (10 <= 16), so we add it
   - num becomes 25

4. The loop ends because num (25) is now greater than target (19)

5. Return ans, which is 2

The algorithm added two coins: 2 and 8. With these additions, we can now obtain any sum from 1 to 19 using some combination of the coins [1,2,4,8,10].

To verify:
- 1 can be obtained using [1]
- 2 can be obtained using [2]
- 3 can be obtained using [1,2]
- 4 can be obtained using [4]
- 5 can be obtained using [1,4]
- ...and so on up to 19.

The key insights from this example are:

1. The algorithm always tries to use existing coins first.
2. When it can't use an existing coin, it adds the smallest possible new coin (num + 1) to fill the gap.
3. By doing this, it ensures that all sums up to the current 'num' are obtainable.
4. The process continues until we can obtain all sums up to the target.

This greedy approach ensures that we add the minimum number of coins necessary to make all sums up to the target obtainable.

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?
